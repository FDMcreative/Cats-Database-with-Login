# Cats-Database-with-Login
### *A database of cats with a login function.*
-

This project creates a webpage which acts as a front end for a database of cats.

Register, Login and Logout functionalities of Users are present so that New, Edit and Delete actions on cats are permitted only to registered & logged users.

A map is also implemented.

-

Difficulties:

- Switch to Leafletjs maps since Google Maps is on payment.
- The database inexplicably  gets an undefined environment, unless explicitly set in config, because, the fallback option doesn't get read.
